最後機會了，如果您還在猶豫不決！COSCUP 2024 徵稿時程最後截止時間在５月 19 日（任何時區）

把握機會整理您手邊的進度、整理腦袋裡肆意混亂的想法，整備好題目與摘要，就可以準備投稿了！

行政組也準備簡單的[指引文件](https://volunteer.coscup.org/docs/zh-TW/about_coscup/how_to_participate/as_speaker/)，可以先看看如何準備投稿，或許可以讓您輕鬆的跨出第一步！

## 「開．源遊會」招商中

今年我們有一個新的企劃「開．源遊會」，預計招募 4-6 攤小吃攤位進駐，目前可能有的類型為糕點類、傳統小吃豆乾。對了，無攤位佈置費用，但唯一需與大會開源理念切合，須 Open Source 一份食譜，並與購買者分享交流！

「開．源遊會」場地會在一間教室空間呈現，倚靠著牆面的四周為攤位擺設區，中間教室區域則設有座位，供用餐與聊天交流區域。

由於我們今年第一次嘗試新的企劃，如果您有一點點想法或進駐意願，歡迎來信到[行政組](mailto:secretary@coscup.org)或直接回信詢問。預計將在六月初會有稍微完整的招商計畫書，歡迎在此之前給我們更多意見一起來形塑新的企劃！

## "Open Source Fair" Vendor Invitation

This year, we are introducing a new initiative called the "Open Source Fair." We are planning to recruit 4-6 snack booths, with potential offerings including pastries and traditional snacks such as dried tofu. Importantly, there are no fees for booth setup, but in the spirit of the open-source philosophy, each vendor is required to open source one recipe, sharing and exchanging it with buyers.

The "Open Source Fair" will take place in a classroom space. Booths will be arranged against the walls, while the central area of the classroom will have seating available for dining and socializing.

As this is our first attempt at this new initiative, if you have any ideas or are interested in participating, please feel free to send us an email at our [secretary team](mailto:secretary@coscup.org) or reply directly to inquire. A more complete vendor plan is expected by early June, and we welcome your feedback before then to help shape this exciting new venture!
