# COSCUP 近期更新：議程公告、前夜派對、會眾服務

Hi {{name}},

再二周後就是 COSCUP 2024，籌備團隊也密鑼緊鼓的努力調度、安排今年的活動，這期電子報內容快速與您同步目前已確定的項目，差不多也可以開始準備與規劃如何參與 COSCUP 了！

## 社群議程發佈

COSCUP 是由開源社群一同參與的年會，各社群議程軌經過來自各方的投稿、審稿後，終於挑選出符合社群主題的稿件。今年約有 500 份稿件送出，約有 400 位提交者，大約 330 件入選，共 41 軌議程。

## 前夜派對

COSCUP 每一年期待的「前夜派對」活動終於可以公告了，**時間於 8/2 18:15**，地點在**華山町餐酒館**。詳細的活動內容與酒券套票請參考活動頁面。

不論隔天是否會參加 COSCUP，只要禮拜五晚上有空，就來和我們喝一杯、聊開源！

另外今年籌備團隊也有特別提醒各開源社群規劃「前夜派對」結束後的「續攤」活動，在活動當天可以多多詢問社群「**等等要到哪裡續攤呢？**」

## 會眾服務

近五年 COSCUP 也慢慢堆起面向會眾參與的活動，希望在活動的二日中，可以體驗到除了大會議程之外，針對身心靈放鬆的活動。

今年我們將「療癒市集」（按摩小站、紅酒瑜伽、療癒彩繪、療癒睡眠）、「療癒講座」（創傷恢復、情感和社會互動的理解等議題講座）、「親子工作坊」（焊接、自製電玩親子手作課程）、「開．源遊會」（開源精神、開源食譜的實踐）合併稱為「會眾服務」。

由於要介紹的項目無法在電子報中詳細說明，可以參考「會眾服務」的介紹頁面。部份活動需要預訂，我們也非常歡迎您能安排時間前往參與或體驗！

另外大會當天也有紀錄組的「形象照」與議程組的 [BoF、Hacking Room](https://blog.coscup.org/2024/06/coscup-2024-bof-hacking-room.html) 可多加利用。

### 「開．源遊會」

這是 2024 新的企劃，我們預計可以招募到 4~6 個攤位與我們一起實踐「開源精神」，目前攤位預訂約 40% 還有空位歡迎來！

第一年嘗試，不收攤位費，詳細的招商方案可以參考說明。

## 最後

我們剩下不到 15 天的時間就要迎接 COSCUP 2024 了！小小的緊張、不知道您準備的如何？這次會是用什麼身分來參與今年的活動呢？講者來分享議程、社群攤位負責人來擺攤推廣、會眾定期來升級開源能量。不管你是用哪種身份來參與、記得認識社群新夥伴也是參與 COSCUP 重要項目之一。

由於這期內容有點多，將一部分的內容移到下週繼續同步，如果你覺得 COSCUP 是個不錯的年會，也歡迎幫我們推薦給更多人，或是鼓勵他們[訂閱電子報（或線上閱讀）](https://volunteer.coscup.org/docs/zh-TW/about_coscup/newsletters/overview/)持續與我們同步資訊！

COSCUP 2024 is just two weeks away! The volunteers team is working hard to arrange and schedule this year's activities. This newsletter provides a quick update on the confirmed items so far. It's about time to start preparing and planning your participation in COSCUP!

## Community Agenda Announcement

COSCUP is an annual conference organized with the participation of the open-source community. After receiving submissions and reviewing them from various sources, the community agenda tracks have finally selected submissions that fit the community themes. This year, around 500 submissions were received from about 400 contributors, with approximately 330 selected for presentation, covering a total of 41 tracks.

## Eve Gathering

The highly anticipated "Eve Gathering" event of COSCUP is finally announced. It will be held on August 2nd at 18:15 at Huashan Ding Bistro(華山町餐酒館). For detailed event information and drink ticket packages, please refer to the event page.

- [Eve Gathering Event Description](https://volunteer.coscup.org/docs/about_coscup/eve_gathering/overview/)

Whether or not you'll be attending COSCUP the next day, if you're free on Friday night, come join us for a drink and chat about open source!

Additionally, this year the volunteers team has specially reminded various open source communities to plan "after-parties" following the "Eve Gathering." On the day of the event, be sure to ask the communities, "Where are we heading for the after-party?"

## Attendee Services

In the past five years, COSCUP has gradually developed activities aimed at attendee participation, hoping that during the two-day event, attendees can experience activities focused on relaxation and well-being, in addition to the main conference agenda.

This year, we have combined the "Healing Market" (massage station, wine yoga, healing painting, healing sleep), "Healing Lectures" (lectures on trauma recovery, understanding emotional and social interactions), "Junior Workshops" (welding, making video games with children), and the "Fun Fair" (practicing the open source spirit and open source recipes) into what we call "Attendee Services."

Due to the limited space in the newsletter, a detailed description of these activities cannot be provided here. Please refer to the "Attendee Services" introduction page. Some activities require reservations, and we warmly welcome you to schedule time to participate or experience these activities!

Additionally, on the day of the event, you can also take advantage of the "Profile Photo" service provided by the Documentation Team and the [BoF, Hacking Room](https://blog.coscup.org/2024/06/coscup-2024-bof-hacking-room.html) arranged by the Agenda Team.

### Fun Fair

This is a new initiative for 2024, and we expect to recruit 4-6 booths to join us in practicing the "open source spirit." Currently, about 40% of the booth reservations have been made, so there are still available spots — you're welcome to join us!

As this is our first year trying this out, we are not charging booth fees. For detailed booth recruitment information, please refer to the description.

## Final Note

We have less than 15 days left until COSCUP 2024! Are you feeling a little nervous? How are your preparations going? This time, in what role will you participate in this year's event? As a speaker sharing your session, a community booth manager promoting your booth, or an attendee upgrading your open-source energy regularly? No matter what role you're participating in, remember that getting to know new community partners is also an important part of attending COSCUP.

Since there's quite a bit of content in this issue, we will continue with more updates next week. If you think COSCUP is a great annual conference, please help us spread the word to more people or encourage them to subscribe to the [newsletter (or read online)](https://volunteer.coscup.org/docs/about_coscup/newsletters/overview/) to stay updated with us!
