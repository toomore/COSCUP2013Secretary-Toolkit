Dear {{name}},

On behalf of the organizing team at COSCUP, I would like to express our gratitude for taking the time to visit our stand at SCaLE21x. We hope that you had an enjoyable and unique experience at our stand.

As you may know, COSCUP is a community-driven open-source conference in Taiwan that shares a similar spirit to SCaLE. Over the past eighteen years, we have aimed to promote the spirit of open-source and foster collaboration among developers and enthusiasts based in Taiwan, and anywhere around the world.

We are thrilled to have the opportunity to meet you and share our passion for open-source. We hope that our interaction has sparked your interest in open-source communities in Taiwan and the Asia-Pacific region and that we were able to give you a glimpse into the exciting developments happening in our region.

If you would like to get to know more about COSCUP, or more communities in Taiwan, please feel free to contact our team at <engagement@coscup.org> or me at <petertc.chu+coscup@gmail.com>. We would be happy to answer any inquiries you may have.

Thank you again for your visit, and we hope to see you at COSCUPâ€™24, SCaLE22x, or any open-source events in the future!

Best regards,
Peter H.R. Chu
