# COSCUP 2024 籌備團隊啟動

Hi {{name}},
COSCUP 2024 籌備團隊已在上週順利展開，各組也開始招募今年的志工夥伴，一起加入我們籌備年度盛會！
這份訊息將引導您準備未來參與 COSCUP 的重要資訊，不論您是以志工、社群夥伴、講者、贊助單位或是會眾們！

## 基礎資訊

COSCUP 2024 暫定在 **08/03 - 08/04**，地點在台灣科技大學。
由於年會是以**開源社群**一同參與籌辦議程的方式進行，預計在二月開始招募開源社群軌，並預計在五月完成議程徵稿。
相關的資訊可以先參考 [2023 過往](https://blog.coscup.org/search?q=2023)的公告來提前準備規劃各項工作事項。

## 加入志工夥伴

目前各組別已在[志工服務平台](https://volunteer.coscup.org/)完成招募資訊更新，如果有興趣參與籌備過程，請詳細閱讀各組甄選資格與遴選方式。
大會依舊會有「[一日志工](https://volunteer.coscup.org/tasks/2023)」於活動二日（或前夜派對）成為志工夥伴的活動，無法完整參與籌備過程也可期待透過「一日志工」方式來參與！

## 近期更新

### 開源市集

「開源市集」暫定這個名稱，希望 2024 能有一區是開源精神與市集活動相關，不論是開源點心、食譜、菜單或是技術書博等形式，詳細的招商內容還在規劃中，如果你有相關的想法與意見，也可直接回信給我們！

### 前往 FOSDEM

COSCUP 即將在一月底出發與開放文化基金會（OCF）一同前往歐洲最大的開源年會 [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2024/)。如果您接下來會在比利時布魯塞爾附近，也歡迎找我們一起吃個飯、喝杯酒、聊開源！攤位位置在：[K Level 2](https://fosdem.org/2024/stands/)（Open Culture Foundation+ Taiwan open source community）。
（轉告 OCF 資訊：如果您參與的社群也想要讓國際夥伴認識，也歡迎透過此活動一同參與，[活動頁面](https://ocf.tw/p/global/fosdem-taiwan-community/)的表單還可填寫、物資請最晚 01/24 前寄達指定地點！）

Hi {{name}},
The COSCUP 2024 organizing team successfully kicked off last week, and each team has started recruiting volunteers for this year. Join us in preparing for the annual event!
This message will guide you through important information for future participation in COSCUP, whether you are a volunteer, community partner, speaker, sponsor, or attendee!

## Basic Information

COSCUP 2024 is tentatively scheduled for **08/03 - 08/04**, and the venue is at National Taiwan University of Science and Technology.
As the conference is organized collaboratively with the participation of open-source communities, we plan to recruit for the open-source community track starting in February, with the program call for proposals expected to be completed in May.
For relevant information, you can refer to [the announcements](https://blog.coscup.org/2023/05/ways-to-join-coscup-2023.html) from the past COSCUP 2023 to prepare in advance for planning various tasks. Or refer to "[COSCUP unveiled / OSI / Paloma Oliveira](https://blog.opensource.org/coscup-unveiled/)".

## Volunteering

Currently, each team has updated recruitment information on [Volunteer Services](https://volunteer.coscup.org/). If you are interested in participating in the preparation process, please carefully read the selection qualifications and procedures for each team.
The conference will continue to have a [One-Day Volunteer](https://volunteer.coscup.org/tasks/2023) activity where participants can become volunteer partners for the two-day event (or pre-party). If you are unable to fully participate in the preparation process, you can still look forward to participating through the [One-Day Volunteer](https://volunteer.coscup.org/tasks/2023) option!

## Recent Updates

### Open Source Market

The name "Open Source Market" is tentative, and we hope to have a section in 2024 that revolves around the spirit of open source and market activities. Whether it's open source snacks, recipes, menus, or technical book fairs, detailed sponsorship content is still being planned. If you have related ideas and opinions, feel free to reply directly to us!

### Heading to FOSDEM

COSCUP is about to depart at the end of January to join forces with the Open Culture Foundation（OCF） for [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2024/), the largest open-source conference in Europe. If you happen to be near Brussels, Belgium in the following days, feel free to join us for a meal, a drink, and a discussion about open source! Our booth will be located at [K Level 2](https://fosdem.org/2024/stands/)（Open Culture Foundation+ Taiwan open source community）.
（Passing on information from OCF: If your community also wants to be known by international partners, you're welcome to participate in this event together. The form on the [event page](https://ocf.tw/p/global/fosdem-taiwan-community/) can be filled out, and materials should reach the designated location no later than 01/24!）

### SCaLE21x

COSCUP will be exhibiting at [SCaLE21x](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/21x). If you are interested in engaging with the North American community in discussions related to open culture and open-source technology, we welcome you to join us!
