# COSCUP 2024 活動前最後一週

Hi {{name}},

COSCUP 2024 迎來最後一週即將在本週六日（8/3, 8/4 於臺科大）舉辦！本期電子報來提醒你準備好了嗎？是不是還有什麼還未完成的，把握最後一週的時間來加緊完成！

## 如何參與、準備 COSCUP

往年我們在最後一週都會準備一份「行前通知信」發送給您，是關於每一年 COSCUP 的活動資訊。有鑑於去年的訊息量太過龐大，把所有的資訊放置在信件中是一件不太實用的方式。

今年，我們撰寫了一份「[如何參與、準備 COSCUP](https://volunteer.coscup.org/docs/zh-TW/about_coscup/how_to_participate/)」的手冊，再透過您所參與的角色屬性來找到合適您的大會資訊。

所有來到 COSCUP 的參與者我們都定義為「[會眾](https://volunteer.coscup.org/docs/zh-TW/about_coscup/how_to_participate/as_attendee/)」，再依您可能為一個或多個角色屬性分為：開源社群、講者、贊助夥伴、籌備團隊閱讀引導手冊。

希望在最後一週的時間幫您梳理混亂的思緒，或是在繁忙的工作日期間快速上手週末的活動！

## 前夜派對

前夜派對已開始販售酒券了，今年有提供 3 張、10 張的套票組可以選購，歡迎大家作伙一起團購！

一張暢飲券可以協助我們折抵場地費用，一樣老規矩：不論你隔天是否要參與 COSCUP，只要 8/2 晚上有空、就來和我們喝一杯、聊開源！

詳細的活動說明與酒券訂購請參考「[前夜派對](https://volunteer.coscup.org/docs/zh-TW/about_coscup/eve_gathering/overview/)」。

## 會眾服務

關於一系列的會眾服務內容，可以參考「[會眾服務](https://volunteer.coscup.org/docs/zh-TW/about_coscup/attendee_services/)」說明頁面，這裡要提醒您的，部份服務需要預先預訂，如：[紅酒瑜伽](https://volunteer.coscup.org/docs/zh-TW/about_coscup/health_market/overview/)、療癒彩繪、療癒睡眠、[親子工作坊](https://volunteer.coscup.org/docs/zh-TW/about_coscup/junior_workshop/overview/)，且有人數上限，如果覺得時間允許，希望好好體驗我們這次的會眾服務企劃。

另外延續「療癒」的主題，我們也有「[療癒講座](https://volunteer.coscup.org/docs/zh-TW/about_coscup/healing_lectures/overview/)」議程，歡迎前往聆聽。

新企劃「[開．源遊會](https://volunteer.coscup.org/docs/zh-TW/about_coscup/fun_fair/overview/)」今年主題為「開源菜單」，有空也可以前往逛逛！另外部份店家已提供預購服務，可以現在訂購，活動日取貨！

## 最後

最後，非常感謝您今年也一起陪我們走到活動前最後一週，也感謝給我們許多籌備期間的指教與建議，如果在會場看到籌備團隊的夥伴，也歡迎持續與我們交流，讓我們可以做的更好！

額外預告，明年 2025 是 COSCUP 的 20 週年，雖然此刻說有點太早，但還是先提醒您，我們可能需要您的協助讓 20 週年更豐富，詳細的概念與企劃可以關注開幕、閉幕前的大會籌備團隊的分享議程。

讓明年 20 週年的里程碑繼續延續「**開源社群驅使的年會**」與「**開源精神**」的實踐！

Hi {{name}},

COSCUP 2024 is entering its final week and will be held this weekend (8/3 and 8/4, at NTUST)! This issue of the newsletter is here to remind you to make sure you're prepared. Is there anything you haven't completed yet? Take advantage of this last week to finish up any remaining tasks!

## How to Participate and Prepare for COSCUP

Every year during the final week, we prepare a "Pre-Event Notification" email for you, providing information about COSCUP's activities. Given that last year's message volume was overwhelming, cramming all the information into an email proved impractical.

This year, we've written a "[How to Participate and Prepare for COSCUP](https://volunteer.coscup.org/docs/about_coscup/how_to_participate/)" manual. Through your role attributes, you can find the information most relevant to you.

All participants at COSCUP are defined as "[attendees](https://volunteer.coscup.org/docs/zh-TW/about_coscup/how_to_participate/as_attendee/)." Depending on your role, whether it be in one or multiple capacities, you can refer to the appropriate guide for: open source communities, speakers, sponsorship partners, and volunteer team members.

We hope this helps you organize your thoughts during the final week and quickly get up to speed for the weekend's activities amidst your busy schedule!

## Eve Gathering

The Eve Gathering has begun selling drink tickets. This year, we offer packages of 3 or 10 tickets for you to choose from, and group purchases are encouraged!

Buying a drink ticket helps us cover venue costs. As per tradition: Whether or not you are attending COSCUP the next day, if you are free on the evening of 8/2, come have a drink and talk open source with us!

For detailed event information and drink ticket purchases, please refer to the [Eve Gathering](https://volunteer.coscup.org/docs/about_coscup/eve_gathering/overview/) page.

## Attendee Services

For information about the series of attendee services, please refer to the [Attendee Services](https://volunteer.coscup.org/docs/about_coscup/attendee_services/) page. We want to remind you that some services require prior reservation, such as: [Wine Yoga](https://volunteer.coscup.org/docs/about_coscup/health_market/overview/), healing painting, peaceful sleep, and the [Junior Workshop](https://volunteer.coscup.org/docs/about_coscup/junior_workshop/overview/). These services have a cap on the number of participants, so if your schedule allows, we hope you can fully enjoy these specially planned attendee services.

Continuing with the "healing" topic, we also have a series of [Healing Lectures](https://volunteer.coscup.org/docs/about_coscup/healing_lectures/overview/) sessions that you are welcome to attend.

The new initiative "Fun Fair" this year is themed "Open Source Menu." Be sure to check it out if you have some free time! Additionally, some vendors are offering pre-order services — you can place an order now and pick it up on the event day! For more details, please visit the [Fun Fair](https://volunteer.coscup.org/docs/about_coscup/fun_fair/overview/) page.

## In Conclusion

Lastly, we want to express our heartfelt gratitude for accompanying us through this final week leading up to the event. We also appreciate all the feedback and suggestions you've given us during the preparation phase. If you see any of the preparation team members at the venue, feel free to continue engaging with us to help us improve!

A heads-up for next year: 2025 marks the 20th anniversary of COSCUP. Although it might seem a bit early to mention, we are already thinking ahead and might need your assistance to make the 20th anniversary even more enriching. Stay tuned for more details on the concept and plans, which will be shared during the opening and closing sessions by the conference preparation team.

Let's make the 20th anniversary milestone an ongoing manifestation of a "community-driven open source conference" and the "spirit of open source"!
