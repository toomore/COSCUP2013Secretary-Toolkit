Hi {{name}} 您好,

感謝您成為 COSCUP 的講者，給予大會豐富且多元的開源議題。此封信件將與您快速同步一些 COSCUP 的活動，希望在活動期間如有空檔也可一同參與。

## 前夜派對

COSCUP 的傳統習慣在活動前一天週五晚上，找一間酒吧，不論隔天是否要參加大會活動（但身為講者的你，應該還是要記得來參加活動！）都可以和大家一起喝一杯、聊開源！時間為 2024/08/02 18:15 - 21:30 UTC+8，地點在華山町餐酒館。

與往年不同的是，今年在前夜派對結束後（21:30），希望各社群可以規劃「續攤」活動，持續找個地方聊聊，不論是許久不見的老朋友，或是在派對上認識的新朋友們。

「前夜派對」詳細的活動內容與酒券訂購，[請參考此頁面](https://volunteer.coscup.org/docs/zh-TW/about_coscup/eve_gathering/overview/)。

## 社群佈告欄

活動場地在臺科大教學大樓內，各樓層的佈告欄都有 COSCUP 為社群規劃的專屬佈告欄，我們希望您個人或是所屬的社群、服務單位都可以好好利用佈告欄來[張貼](https://www.flickr.com/photos/coscup/)個人開源專案、社群簡介或活動預告資訊、甚至是您社群的年會時間表…等任何與開源有關的宣傳事宜。

我們希望會眾、參與者也可以透過佈告欄的管道獲取開源社群資訊，或許您的社群今年在大會無社群攤位，佈告欄也是一個不錯的宣傳方式。

往年的規劃，大約會需要 20 份左右的張貼傳單數量就可以涵蓋所有的佈告欄，如果您有興趣想要在佈告欄上面張貼訊息，也可以參考開放文化基金會年初前往 FOSDEM 的[傳單宣傳方式](https://ocf.tw/p/global/fosdem-2024/)。

## 臺灣飲食指南

這部份需要和您說聲不好意思，今年無法在大會前完成臺灣飲食指南，但我們有找到一些還不錯的內容，如果您從其他國家來參與 COSCUP，希望能讓您感到特別！

## 會眾服務

COSCUP 今年將一系列的活動整合成「會眾服務」來宣傳，相關的服務有：按摩小站、紅酒瑜伽、療癒市集與講座、開．源遊會、親子工作坊…等服務，詳細的介紹與參與方式可以[參考活動資訊](https://volunteer.coscup.org/docs/zh-TW/about_coscup/attendee_services/)。

「開．源遊會」還在招商中，只要符合「開源菜單」的主題就可以來擺攤，有適合的攤位也可幫我們傳遞此資訊！

## 最後

以上是[行政組](https://volunteer.coscup.org/docs/zh-TW/secretary_team/overview/)幫各位整理的大會資訊，有任何疑問都歡迎直接回信詢問，也歡迎[訂閱電子報](https://volunteer.coscup.org/docs/zh-TW/about_coscup/newsletters/overview/)持續關注我們，再過不到二週的時間，還是要殘酷的提醒您**「簡報做完了嗎？」（驚嚇）**，我們到時會場見吧！

Dear {{name}},

Thank you for becoming a speaker at COSCUP, enriching the conference with diverse open-source topics. This email will quickly update you on some COSCUP activities, hoping that you can also participate if you have some free time during the event.

## Eve Gathering

A longstanding tradition of COSCUP is to find a bar on the Friday night before the event. Whether or not you plan to attend the conference activities the next day (but as a speaker, you should still remember to attend!), you can join everyone for a drink and chat about open source! The time is from 18:15 to 21:30 (UTC+8) on August 2, 2024, at Huashan Ding Bistro(華山町餐酒館).

Unlike previous years, this year after the Eve Gathering ends (21:30), we hope each community can plan "after-party" activities to continue the conversations, whether with old friends you haven't seen in a while or new friends you meet at the party.

For detailed information about the "Eve Gathering" and drink ticket purchases, [please refer to this page](https://volunteer.coscup.org/docs/about_coscup/eve_gathering/overview/).

## Community Bulletin Board

The event will be held in the teaching building of NTUST. On each floor, there are designated bulletin boards planned by COSCUP for the community. We encourage you, your community, or your service unit to make good use of these bulletin boards to [post](https://www.flickr.com/photos/coscup/) information about your personal open-source projects, community profiles, event announcements, or even your community's annual meeting schedule — any kind of promotion related to open source.

We hope attendees and participants can also obtain open-source community information through these bulletin boards. Even if your community does not have a booth this year, the bulletin board is still a great way to promote.

From past experience, around 20 flyers should be enough to cover all the bulletin boards. If you are interested in posting information on the bulletin boards, you can also refer to the [flyer promotion method](https://ocf.tw/en/p/global/fosdem-2024/) used by the Open Culture Foundation at the beginning of the year at FOSDEM.

## Taiwan Food Guide

We apologize that we couldn't complete the Taiwan Food Guide before the conference this year. However, we found some good content that we hope will make your visit special, especially if you're coming from another country to attend COSCUP!

## Attendee Services

This year, COSCUP has integrated a series of activities under "Attendee Services" for promotion. The related services include: Massage Station, Wine Yoga, Healing Market and Lectures, Fun Fair, Junior Workshops, and more. For detailed introductions and how to participate, please [refer to the activity information](https://volunteer.coscup.org/docs/about_coscup/attendee_services/).

The "Fun Fair" is still open for booth recruitment. As long as your booth fits the theme of "open source menus," you're welcome to join. If you know any suitable booths, please help us spread the word!

## Final Note

The above is the conference information compiled by the [Secretary Team](https://volunteer.coscup.org/docs/zh-TW/secretary_team/overview/). If you have any questions, feel free to reply directly, and you're also welcome to subscribe to [our newsletter](https://volunteer.coscup.org/docs/about_coscup/newsletters/overview/) to stay updated. With less than two weeks to go, we must gently remind you, **"Is your presentation ready?"（:scream:）** We'll see you at the venue!
