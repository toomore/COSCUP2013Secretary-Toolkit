# 社群回憶錄 - 開源運動在臺灣

嗨 {{name}} 👋,

這一期的電子報內容稍微不一樣，需要幫忙募集大家的回憶，什麼的回憶呢？在過往的十年或二十年間，不論你參與在哪一個時間區段中、一定有著代表那一時間的人事物！

還記得你第一次參與開源年會時的激動嗎？還記得你第一次站上講台將閃電秀的時候嗎？或是在你的回憶裡，什麼是代表著臺灣開源運動的里程碑，是搶票搶到整個售票亭都不見了！還是在大街上找銀樓買鑽戒、在 BoF 下跪求婚成功！

或是我所緬懷的夥伴離開我們多久了 ⋯⋯

[開放文化基金會](https://ocf.tw/)今年發起「社群回憶錄 - 開源運動在臺灣」的策展計畫，需要借助、拼湊你我的回憶募集！在此邀請 COSCUP 夥伴的你，一起動動手，將回憶紀錄、永流傳！

由於開放文化基金會需要時間將影像與文字輸出，如果可以的話，**請在 7/12 前完成**，讓我們一起打造臺灣開源科技的特展！

- 共筆策展「國際開源史」、「臺灣組織與社群大事記」、「開源貢獻者名錄」，還可以報名到「自由展區」參展！！ [https://reurl.cc/OMN1Q9](https://reurl.cc/OMN1Q9)
- 如果你手上有值得回憶的照片，也歡迎和我們分享。 [https://reurl.cc/MOQvgK](https://reurl.cc/MOQvgK)
  如果你手邊有其他的文物或是無法用目前的形式提供，也非常歡迎直接與開放文化基金會聯絡，或是直接寫信說明： [hi@ocf.tw](mailto:hi@ocf.tw)

Hi {{name}} 👋,

The content of this issue of our newsletter is a bit different as we need your help to gather everyone's memories. What kind of memories, you ask? Over the past ten or twenty years, regardless of when you were involved, there must be people, happenings, or things that represent that period!

Do you remember the excitement when you first participated in the open source conference? Do you remember the moment you first stood on stage for a lightning talk? Or in your memories, what stands as a milestone of the open source movement in Taiwan? Was it a ticket rush so intense that the entire ticketing kiosk vanished? Or perhaps buying a diamond ring at a jewelry store on the street and successfully proposing during a BoF session?

Or maybe you recall how long it’s been since our cherished partners left us...

The [Open Culture Foundation](https://ocf.tw/en/) has launched a curatorial project this year titled "Community Memoirs - The Open Source Movement in Taiwan," and we need to gather and piece together our shared memories! We invite you, our COSCUP partners, to take a moment to record these memories and make them last forever!

Since the Open Culture Foundation needs time to compile the images and text, if possible, please complete your submissions **by July 12th**. Let’s come together to create a special exhibition on Taiwan's open source technology!

- Co-curate "International Open Source History," "Major Events of Taiwan Organizations and Communities," and "Open Source Contributors Directory." You can also register to exhibit in the "Free Exhibition Zone"! [https://reurl.cc/OMN1Q9](https://reurl.cc/OMN1Q9)
- If you have memorable photos, feel free to share them with us. [https://reurl.cc/MOQvgK](https://reurl.cc/MOQvgK)

If you have other artifacts or items that cannot be provided in the current format, you are also very welcome to contact the Open Culture Foundation directly or write an email explaining: [hi@ocf.tw](mailto:hi@ocf.tw)
