Hi {{name}},
COSCUP 2023 即將開始了，距離 7/29 剩下不到一個月的時間，地點依舊在**臺灣科技大學**。目前我們有些訊息可以提供給你預先準備，讓我們一步步邁向活動開幕日！
另外還有一件事情，COSCUP 是**不用售票**、**自由入場**，而且是與一群**開源社群**舉辦的年度盛會，時間到、直接來就對，門也是 Open 的！

## 各項預告

6. [開源星手村](https://openstartervillage.ocf.tw/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=advance_notice&utm_id=paper230708)：不是很瞭解開源精神、開放文化是什麼，沒關係！「療癒市集」邀請到開放文化基金會透過４場桌遊活動的方式引導進入開源領域！歡迎[組隊報名參與](https://forms.gle/YYaaiwBpeQu1MTYF9)（當作 Team building 也不錯！）
