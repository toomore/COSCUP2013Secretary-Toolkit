Hi {{name}},
There are less than 10 days left until COSCUP 2023! If there are any important events that you shouldn't miss recently, a summary is prepared for you below.
A reminder once again, COSCUP does not require tickets, it's free entry, and it's an annual event held together with a group of open source communities. Just come directly when it's time, the door is also open!

## Recent updates

Please check the content and schedule a time to host a BoF (Birds of a Feather) meetup. (Is there anyone still wanting to host a PGP key signing BoF? Wait, what is PGP? Will there be a souvenir exchange event like last year this year?)
2. Lightning talk 2.0: It has also been [announced](https://blog.coscup.org/2023/07/coscup-lightning-talk-20.html?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=advance_notice_230720) that the duration has been reduced from 5 minutes in previous years to 3 minutes this year. If there is any mistake on stage, it may disappear immediately... (Sign up first)
