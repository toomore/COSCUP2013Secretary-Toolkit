## Prime Session

我們今年非常榮幸地透過 Ruby Taiwan 社群的協助，邀請到知名的程式語言 Ruby 的創始人——Matz（松本行弘），蒞臨 COSCUP 並擔任本次大會的 Keynote 講者！

Matz 是全球開源社群中極具影響力的人物之一，他所創造的 Ruby 不僅在網頁開發、IOT 等等不同領域廣泛應用，更深深影響了無數開發者對程式語言設計的看法與實踐。今年，Matz 將在 COSCUP 與我們分享他對開源、程式語言設計，以及開發者文化的深刻見解與經驗，相信將是一場不容錯過的精彩演講！

邀請您一同參與這場開源盛會，與來自世界各地的開發者交流，並近距離聆聽 Matz 的第一手分享！

We are thrilled to announce that Matz (Yukihiro Matsumoto), the creator of the well-known open-source programming language Ruby, will be joining COSCUP as this year’s keynote speaker, thanks to the support of the Ruby Taiwan community!

Matz is a legendary figure in the global open-source ecosystem. His creation, Ruby, has become a widely adopted language in web, IOT, and various domains, and has profoundly influenced how developers think about programming language design. At COSCUP, Matz will share his insights on open source, programming language philosophy, and developer culture — a keynote you won’t want to miss!

Join us for this vibrant celebration of open source, connect with developers from around the world, and hear directly from Matz himself!

## 志工招募 Volunteer Recruitment

想要一起籌備 COSCUP 20 周年活動嗎？以下組別正在熱烈招募夥伴中：

Want to help prepare for the 20th anniversary of COSCUP? The following groups are actively recruiting partners:

### 場務組 Venue Management

撐起大會活動的重要組別之一，歡迎第一次想參與志恩歐工，但不確定可以去哪裡的夥伴，先來場務組認識新朋友！

場務組主要分為：報到、餐飲、攤位、物流、機動。各小組在會場將以排班的方式進行，休息時間，志工可以自由地聽議程、逛攤位、參與 COSCUP 其他的活動！

One of the key teams supporting the conference activities, the venue management team welcomes first-time volunteers who are unsure where to start. Join the venue management team to meet new friends!

The venue management team is mainly divided into: registration, catering, booths, logistics, and mobility. Each subgroup will operate on a shift basis at the venue. During break times, volunteers are free to attend sessions, visit booths, and participate in other COSCUP activities!

### 記錄組 Documentary

主要工作內容在大會活動中、靜態影像的紀錄。對於喜愛拍攝人像、紀錄美好瞬間，或是想要練習捕捉精彩時刻的畫面的夥伴，是個很棒的選擇。

記錄組有一個有趣的任務：在大會中提供形象照拍攝。

COSCUP 將在會場建立專業攝影棚，對於攝影棚拍攝感興趣的夥伴，不容錯過本次機會，拍好拍滿各式各樣攝影棚照片！

過去棚拍可以參考本[相簿](https://www.flickr.com/photos/coscup/albums/72177720319289181/)。

The main tasks involve recording static images during the conference activities. For those who love portrait photography, capturing beautiful moments, or want to practice capturing exciting moments, this is a great choice.

The documentation team has an interesting task: providing portrait photography during the conference. COSCUP will set up a professional photo studio at the venue. For those interested in studio photography, don't miss this opportunity to take a variety of studio photos!

You can refer to the past studio photos in this [album](https://www.flickr.com/photos/coscup/albums/72177720319289181/).

### 製播組 Production and Broadcasting

主要工作內容協助議程錄影、檢查設備、記憶卡更換與回收。部分工作事項在會後的剪輯與整理。COSCUP製播組團隊已是非常專業的志工夥伴，在各大研討會提供專業的技術支援。若有興趣加入製播組，請您盡情展現您的熱情與被託付任務的責任感，到志工平台投出申請！

The main tasks include assisting with agenda recording, checking equipment, replacing and collecting memory cards. Some tasks involve editing and organizing after the event. The COSCUP production team is already a very professional group of volunteers, providing technical support at major conferences. If you are interested in joining the production team, please show your enthusiasm and sense of responsibility for the assigned tasks, and submit your application on the volunteer platform!
