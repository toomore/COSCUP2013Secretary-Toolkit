## 20 週年的情報解禁 20th Anniversary Secrets Unlocked

“In order to know where we’re going, we must remember where we came from.”

COSCUP 20 周年，我們不只是慶祝，更要回顧與前行。COSCUP 一共規劃三大主題，與舊雨新知們一同回憶 COSCUP 從無到有，歷經的 20 年漫漫長路。

COSCUP 20th Anniversary – More Than a Celebration, It's a Time to Reflect and Look Ahead. COSCUP has planned three major themes to journey through the past two decades, reminiscing with both old friends and new how COSCUP came to be and the long road it has traveled.

## 一、COSCUP 回娘家 Return COSCUP

今年誠摯邀請各組歷年的工人回來參加 COSCUP ，不論年分、職務與組別，聊聊當年籌備 COSCUP 的甘苦談。也歡迎大家告訴大家，歡迎所有過去曾經參與過 COSCUP 的組員們回家看看，可能會有神秘小禮物喔 (　ﾟ∀ﾟ) ﾉ♡

We sincerely invite all past COSCUP team members to come back and join the celebration—regardless of the year, role, or team. Let’s reconnect and reminisce about the joys and challenges of organizing COSCUP over the years.

Feel free to spread the word—everyone who has ever been part of COSCUP is welcome to come home and take a look around. There might even be a little surprise gift waiting for you! (　ﾟ∀ﾟ) ﾉ♡

二、COSCUP 大事件 COSCUP Milestones

從第一場聚會到今天的年度盛會，COSCUP 已走過 20 個年頭。這段旅程，充滿了熱情、挑戰與無數開源人的努力。當然，20 年的長度，總有一些重要的歷史節點。COSCUP 大事件將為大家回顧，COSCUP 過去 20 年的重要節點，歡迎大家前往[共筆文件](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zKLMymk5FeiEZHvnAMWqHfxIfXbkG5Umu5ZL4txLVGk/edit?tab=t.0)，一同回憶 COSCUP 20 年的旅程。

這不是歷史，而是我們共同寫下的故事。記得我們怎麼來的，才能走得更遠  (♡˙︶˙ ♡)

From the very first gathering to today’s annual event, COSCUP has journeyed through 20 incredible years. This path has been filled with passion, challenges, and the tireless efforts of countless open source contributors.

Naturally, over two decades, there have been many key milestones worth remembering.

The 'COSCUP Milestones' project invites everyone to revisit these important moments from the past 20 years. You're welcome to explore and contribute to our collaborative document as we reflect on COSCUP’s journey together.

This isn’t just history—it’s a story we’ve written together. By remembering where we came from, we can go even further   (♡˙︶˙ ♡)

三、小啄成長史 Growth of CodePecker

不知道大家有沒有發現近期 COSCUP 社群在回顧小啄成長史呢 ? 小啄其實已經有 16 歲了！陪伴 COSCUP 走過十六年，而在他成長的過程中，不僅外表逐漸變化。小啄也從每年定期出現的吉祥物，成長至可以跟著 COSCUP 去旅行的好夥伴！讓我們跟著 20 周年計畫，一起回顧小啄的出生、轉變，與小啄小夥伴的誕生。

活動當日還有根據小啄設計的小活動區塊，誠摯邀請各位小啄好朋友來參觀 (╭￣3￣)╭♡

Have you noticed that the COSCUP community has recently been looking back at the growth journey of CodePecker? CodePecker is already 16 years old!  For sixteen years, this beloved mascot has accompanied COSCUP, evolving not only in appearance but also in spirit.

From being a recurring annual mascot, CodePecker has grown into a travel companion who journeys with COSCUP.

As part of our 20th anniversary celebration, we invite you to revisit CodePecker’s origins, transformations, and the birth of his little companions.

On the event day, there will also be a special activity area inspired by CodePecker’s design. We warmly welcome all of CodePecker’s friends to come and explore!

## COSCUP 主視覺與新官網 COSCUP Main Visual and New Official Website

感謝有你，一路相伴！COSCUP x RubyConf Taiwan 2025 官網上線了 🎉 🎉 🎉

Thank you for being with us every step of the way! The official website for COSCUP x RubyConf Taiwan 2025 is now live! 🎉🎉🎉

COSCUP 今年主視覺記憶列車情報解禁！主視覺採用可愛卡通風格，融合開源社群的多元與活力，打造出一幅充滿趣味與象徵意義的畫面。

首先利用粉紅色主視覺設計，表達科技也可以很可愛的意涵，鮮豔的色彩不僅吸睛且充滿活力，營造出歡樂的氛圍。同時使用大量如文件夾、文件與復古電腦視窗等，象徵科技與開源的核心精神：分享、協作與透明。

除此之外，我們希望透過粉色火車與其他動態元素，表達 COSCUP 20 年，經過不同的風景，不同的人上上下下，帶來「前進」、「連結」與「社群共乘」的意象。

列車緩緩啟動，蒸汽在晨霧中盤旋，下一站，我們又將前往哪裡？ 記憶列車不僅是官網主視覺，更是一場開源旅程的邀請函。

👉如果您沒看過我們的主視覺，邀請您來[這邊](https://www.facebook.com/coscup/posts/719430130766947:719430130766947)看看

官網設計部分，COSCUP 不僅維持過往簡潔俐落的畫面設計、直覺的操作介面，與完美的行動裝置支援，讓 COSCUP 會眾們可以隨時隨地輕鬆瀏覽！

今年官網還提供了更多元的地圖導航，並提供一鍵訂閱電子日曆活動日期，為會眾帶來更流暢、更貼心的使用體驗！

現在就立即前往 https://coscup.org/2025/，一起感受一下 COSCUP 新官網 (*´∀`)~♥

This year’s COSCUP main visual, “The Memory Train,” has arrived! Designed in a charming cartoon style, the visual blends the diversity and energy of the open source community into a playful and symbolic scene.

The use of a vibrant pink theme shows that technology can be cute too! The bright colors are eye-catching and full of life, creating a joyful atmosphere.

The design also features elements like folders, documents, and retro computer windows—symbols of the core values of technology and open source: sharing, collaboration, and transparency.

In addition, the pink train and dynamic visual elements represent COSCUP’s 20-year journey—passing through different landscapes, with people getting on and off, symbolizing progress, connection, and community co-travel.

As the train slowly departs, steam swirling in the morning mist, we ask: Where will our next stop be?

The Memory Train is not just a visual—it’s an invitation to join us on this open source journey.

👉 If you haven’t seen our main visual yet, we warmly invite you to [check it out](https://www.facebook.com/coscup/posts/719430130766947:719430130766947)!

In terms of website design, COSCUP continues to uphold its signature clean and intuitive interface, along with seamless mobile support—making it easy for attendees to browse anytime, anywhere!

This year, the official site also introduces enhanced features, including more diverse map navigation and one-click subscription to the event calendar, offering a smoother and more thoughtful user experience.
